The specification of the Chord protocol can be found in the paperChord: A Scalable Peer-to-peer Lookup Service for Internet Applicationsby Ion Stoica,  Robert  Morris,  David  Karger,  M.  Frans  Kaashoek,  Hari  Balakrishnan. Additionally, you can also refer to the Wikipedia page: Chord(peer-to-peer). The paper above, in section 2.3 contains a specification of the Chord API and of the API to be implemented by the application. The aim of the project is to implement the network join and routing as described in the Chord paper (Section 4) and encode the simple application that associates a key (same as the ids used in Chord) with a string.

Detailed Project Report is included along with Code
